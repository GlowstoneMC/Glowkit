# Glowkit
Glowkit is a fork of the legendary [Bukkit API](https://bukkit.org), 
as continued by [Spigot](https://spigotmc.org), intended for use with Glowstone.

Plugins designed for the original Bukkit API will continue to run on Glowstone, with zero or minimal changes.

The Glowkit Javadocs are available [here](https://glowstone.net/jd/glowkit/).

If you'd like to take advantage of APIs not available in Bukkit, [check out](https://glowstone.net/jd/glowstone/)
the APIs built into Glowstone itself.
